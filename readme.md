## the cms ! a handy guide
Welcome to Indigo's CMS!
Online Production builds out pages within our CMS which is called Ektron. Ektron has a .NET backend and we have HEAVILY customized it in house. Indigo developers have been building out features for our needs for years at this point so it is kind of its own specific CMS. It has many quirks and specificities. 

### preview and prod
OP has access to a staging environment called *preview* and the live version of the site that we call *production* or *prod*. When you are working on developing a new project, page, or feature you will work in preview. preview is accessed when you are on the indigo network and enter `preview.` before any indigo URL. Here you will get a set of tools in a bar across the top of your screen.  `FILE`, `VIEW`, `PROPERTIES`, and `HELP`.

`FILE` has the options to 
*edit* which will open the page up for editing
*publish* which means send through to live site
*check-in* which means to save and update to preview site only
*cancel* which cancels changes you've made while in editing mode

`VIEW` will give links to the page either in (workarea or extra tools)(#workarea-vs-extra-tools) by clicking on properties

`PROPERTIES` gives you relevant info to the page you're on such as the most recent editor, ID, template, and its status `approved (A)`, `checked-in (I)`, or `pending(P)`.

`HELP` launhes the help page.
